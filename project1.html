            <p>Danesh Global Resources Ltd was established by two couple that were Vision driven in 2019. It all began with their desire to see that needs were met and satisfaction is derived by all. They began with poultry farming with about 200 broiler chicken and later increased it to 1000 and on and on. few months into the raising of broiler chichen, they introduced <strong> layers chicken</strong> into their farm. By the middle of 2022, they diversified by investing into <em>home cleaning appliances</em> which brought them a lot of success becuase they succeded in registering their product in every home. Recently the couples have moved onto the next stage of their businesses dream as they have again diversified in to <strong>Properties acquisition.</strong>
